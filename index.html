					Invoking or running a function expression immediately after it has
					been created. A function without imediately invoking it will just
					return the function.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since creating anonymous functions on the fly wont work, we can use a
					function expression in parentheses (), so that the JavaSript engine
					can understands. “I don’t mean this to be my kind of normal function
					statement, I mean this to be an expression, something that’s created
					on the fly" (Tricks the Syntax Parser) 
					<ul>
						<li>
							You’ll see this style in almost
							every framework and library today.

					var firstname = 'Marc';

					(function(name)) {
					var greeting = 'Inside IIFE: Hello';
					console.log(greeting + ' ' + name);

				<header>JSON and Object Literals</header>
				<p>
					JSON which stands for JavaScript Object Notation, is inspired by
					object literal syntax In JavaScript and looks an awful lot like it but
					they are not the SAME! In previous years data was sent over the
					internet in a different format, the one landed upon for a while was
					XML. But the problem is there is a lot of unnecessary characters that
					make the amount of data that you’re sending larger. Sending one piece
					of data, would be sending the property name twice (WASTE OF
					BANDWIDTH).
				</p>
				<p>
					So people were like what if we sent data in JSON format, now a days we
					pretty much just use JSON to send data. It's just a string of data but
					it looks like object literal syntax. Difference is that Properties
					must be wrapped with “” quotes, it doesn't let you put functions as
					values of a property. JSON isn’t really part of JavaScript, but
					because its so popular and so easy for JS to understand it, JS has
					some built in functionality to transfer data between the two. 
					<ul>
						<li>
							JSON.stringify(-object name-) will convert the object to a JSON string
						</li>
						<li>
							JSON.parse(-string here-) will convert a string to a JS object
						</li>
					</ul>
					
					
				</p>
				<code>
					var objectLiteral = {
						firstName: 'Marc',
						isAProgrammer: true
					}
					console.log(JSON.stringify(objectLiteral));

					var jsonValue = JSON.parse('{ "firstname": "Mary", "isAPRogrammer": true }');

					console.log(jsonValue);

				<header>Closures</header>
				<p>
					When the var sayHi line is executed, it creates an execution context
					for the greet() function and after it's completed, it will pop out of
					the execution stack but the variable that we passed ‘Hi’ remains in
					memory. Even though the greet function ended, any function will still
					have access to that greet functions memory space.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus the sayHi(‘Tony’) can go down the scope chain and check the value
					for whattosay since it could find it in its own execution context And
					so this phenomenon of it closing in all the variables that it’s
					supposed to have access to, is called a CLOSURE. 
					<ul>
						<li>
							Closures are simply a
							feature of the JS language, we didn’t really create it rather JS did
							it for us.
						</li>
					</ul>
				
				</p>
				<code>function greet(whattosay) {
					return function(name) {
						console.log(whattosay + ' ' + name);
					}
					}
				var sayHi = greet('Hi');
				sayHi('Tony');

				<p>
					Function Constructors- A normal function that is used to construct
					objects - The ‘this’ variable points a new empty object, and that
					object is returned from the function automatically So what we’re doing
					we’re simply utilizing features in the JavaScript language that lets
					us construct or build objects. ‘new’ is actually an operator. So we
					created a new object using ‘new’, then called the Person() function
					with the ‘this’ variable pointing to that empty object And whatever I
					do using the this variable will end up being part of that new object,
					this is letting me construct an object via a function
				</p>
				<p>
					The Important thing is that the ‘new’ keyword sets the ‘this’ keyword
					to a brand new empty object, and if you don’t return anything from
					that function, instead of returning undefined it will return that
					empty object, but now worked on by you perhaps inside that function
					using the this keyword. If we want to make it for different and more
					people, we add the parameters, so this.firstname sets the property for
					the empty object and = firstname is the parameter we passed in
				</p>
				<code>
					function Person(firstname, lastname) {
 
						console.log(this);
						this.firstname = firstname;
						this.lastname = lastname;
						console.log('This function is invoked.');
						
					}
					
					var john = new Person('John', 'Doe');
					console.log(john);
					
					var jane = new Person('Jane', 'Doe');
					console.log(jane);
				</code>

				<header>Function Constructors and .prototype</header>
				<p>Every function has a prototype property (think of it as a recipe for objects stored in the __proto__)!
					<ul>
						<li>It is only used by the ‘new’ operator.</li>
					</ul>
					From an efficiency standpoint its better to put your methods in a prototype because they only need one copy to be used (Saves memory space)
					</p>
				<p>But we can keep those properties for each object in person like the firstname and lastname properties because it is going to have different values per object, but for methods I only need one! </p>
				<code>
					function Person(firstname, lastname) {
 
						console.log(this);
						this.firstname = firstname;
						this.lastname = lastname;
						console.log('This function is invoked.');
						
					}
					
					Person.prototype.getFullName = function() {
						return this.firstname + ' ' + this.lastname;   
					}
					
					var john = new Person('John', 'Doe');
					console.log(john);
					
					var jane = new Person('Jane', 'Doe');
					console.log(jane);
					
					Person.prototype.getFormalFullName = function() {
						return this.lastname + ', ' + this.firstname;   
					}
					
					console.log(john.getFormalFullName());
